    <p>The threee important data roles are: </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Data Science</li>
            <li>Data Egineering</li>
            <li>Data Analytics</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Data science refers to the field of extracting insights and knowledge from data using various statistical and computational
        <br> techniques. Data scientists are responsible for developing algorithms, models, and statistical analyses to extract insights
        <br>and actionable information from complex datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data engineering is all about the design, construction, maintenance, and scaling of the data architecture and infrastructure
        <br>that supports business applications and analytics. Data engineers build and manage the data pipelines that allow data
        <br>scientists and analysts to extract insights from the data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data analytics is the process of examining and interpreting data to discern patterns and draw conclusions from the data.
        <br>Data analysts analyze large amounts of information and communicate their findings to non-technical stakeholders in a
        <br>clear and concise way, driving data-driven decision-making in the business.
        <br>They also collaborate with data scientists and engineers to ensure the data is clean, reliable and easy to access.
    </p>
    <p>
        In conclusion, the field of data science, data engineering, and data analytics are all integral components of data-driven
        <br>decision-making in the modern business landscape.While data scientists develop algorithms and models to extract insights
        <br>and knowledge from data, data engineers ensure the underlying data architecture and infrastructure is reliable and scalable.
        <br>Data analysts, on the other hand, translate the findings into easy to understand results which help non-technical stakeholders
        <br>make informed decisions.Together, these roles play a critical role in driving innovation, increasing efficiency, and creating
        <br>a competitive edge for businesses across all industries.
